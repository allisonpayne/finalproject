## Replicating a metapopulation analysis

We are replicating [@ozsanlav2023differing], 'Differing drivers of decline within a migratory metapopulation has implications for future conservation'.

The paper's Github is [here](https://github.com/LukeOzsanlav/GWfGMetapopDemography).

The Zenodo repository is [here](https://zenodo.org/records/8116139).

**Paper description:** This paper looks at a metapopulation of Greenland White-fronted geese (*Albifrons flavrostris*). There are two subpopulations: a southerly and northerly. One subpopulation is doing worse than the other, and so this paper performed analyses on the metapopulation and compared them for each subpopulation.

Let's look through the dataaaaa \<3
