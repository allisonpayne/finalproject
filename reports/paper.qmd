## Paper Description

[Ozsanlav-Harris et al.2023](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/ece3.10281) looks at two UK sub-populations of the Greenland white-fronted goose (*albifrons flavirostris*): one at Islay and one at Wexford. They compared each sub-population with a meta-population to see if trends in the sub-populations mirrored trends in the meta-population. Their findings have implications for conservation, since management decisions are sometimes made for an entire species without taking into variation between populations. We wanted to replicate figure 2, in which the authors explore how winter population counts and percentagage of juveniles vary between 1983 and 2018. Through this figure, the authors visualize how populations have declined over the course of the study period, and whether the sub-populations mirror the meta-population.

## Data Summary

Ozsanlav-Harris et al. 2023 plotted how Ireland sub-population counts and percentages of juvenile Greenland White Fronted Geese changed from 1983 to 2019 using annual census data. This team was specifically interested in understanding how population counts and reproduction changed with varying temperatures and precipitation. From this set of figures, they identified that the metapopulation has declined since 1999 but only one of the metapopulations has mirrored this trend.

The data provided by Ozsanlav-Harris et al. 2023 was saved as two CSV files. The CSV file for the entire metapopulation included the year the spring census was conducted, the whole population size estimate, and the counts per metapopulation. We then modified this original file so that the metapopulation data was in long format rather than in wide. The CSV file for the juveniles included the year and the percent juveniles for each metapopulation.

## Analysis Summary

Our data analysis comprised of regenerating the Figure 2 of the original manuscript. The data provided by the authors was well documented and relatively straightforward to work with and required minimal manipulation to fully reproduce both panels of our figure.

To visualize the global, Islay, and Wexford population counts for Fig. 2A, we reformatted the `GWfG Pop counts.csv` using the `pivot_longer()` command. This allowed us to consolidate data such that instead of each population having an associated data column populated with population counts, we made one `site` and one `count` column that together describe the site and its associated population count. This manipulation allowed us to specify `site` as a value on to which we could map different `geom_line()` values and visualize the three different population counts.

```{r}
#| include: FALSE
#| 
library(tidyverse) 
library(zoo) #used for calculating moving average 
library(here)

```

```{r}

pop_count <- read.csv(here("data/OG/GWfG Pop counts.csv"))
pop_count_long <- pivot_longer(data = pop_count, 
                          cols = c("Population.estimate", "Wexford", "Islay"), 
                          names_to = "site", values_to = "count") %>% 
  select(-c("Missing.data", "X")) #unnecessary columns

head(pop_count)
head(pop_count_long)
```

We indexed the `pop_count` dataframe to find the year at which the population count was highest. We saved this value to its own vector called `max_mp` so that we could recreate the dashed line observed in Fig. 2 which represents the metapopulation peak.

```{r}
max_mp <- pop_count$spring[which.max(pop_count$Population.estimate)]
```

To visualize the proportion of young geese observed and calculate the 3-year running average in the Islay and Wexford sub-populations for Fig. 2B, we used the `zoo` package and `roll_mean ()` function to calculate the 3-year running average. The paper did not specify how the running average was calculated, but we assumed a default of `center` alignment in which the mean is calculated by using one value to the left and another to the right of the central value.

```{r}
young_count <- read.csv(here("data/OG/GWfG Islay Wexford young counts long format.csv"))

young_count <- young_count %>%
  group_by(Ringing.location) %>%
  mutate(roll_mean = rollmean(Perc_young, k = 3, align = "center", fill = NA))
```
